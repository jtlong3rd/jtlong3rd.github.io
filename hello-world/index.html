            <p>First, I'll give the TL;DR: I'm a formally trained mathematician with a CS degree who, after taking a hiatus from software development for grad school, is "coming back home."</p>

<p>It would be a monumental undertaking for me to use one blog post to fully elaborate upon that deceptively concise summary, so I'll settle on writing the occasional "flashback" post, starting now.</p>

<h2>First Forays into Programming</h2>  

<p>Aside from the obligatory "Hello World," my first ever program was a gas mileage calculator which I wrote to impress the smartest girl in my fifth grade class. It was written in an old dialect of BASIC known as Really Basic BASIC. Suffice it to say that the associated compiler ran in DOS!</p>

<p>(On a not-so-unrelated note, this experience also proved to be my first exposure to the friend zone.)</p>

<p>I spent the next several years writing simple games and utilities for the TI-8X line of graphing calculators, and when it came time to register for freshman-year courses in high school, I was ecstatic to see such offerings as "Programming in C and C++" and "Programming in Java." Needless to say, I spent all four years in high school fitting in as many of these courses as possible. It is a testament to the quality of my school district that I finished K-12 knowing many of the fine points of object-oriented programming (polymorphism, abstract classes, etc.).</p>

<h2>College: Things Getting Interesting</h2>  

<p>Given how many programming courses I had (voluntarily!) taken in high school, it was only natural that I'd major in computer science. I also planned to major in mathematics, as I thought that major would be "icing on the cake" for some employers.</p>

<p>(As I'll elaborate upon later, I certainly learned why many top computer science departments in the US, including my alma mater [Moravian College], have gone from using Java/C++ to Python for their CS 101-2 sequence.)</p>

<p>Some fun facts from my CS major:</p>

<ul>  
<li>I participated in the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (Mid-Atlantic Region) all four years in college. My team's best finish was 8th in the region (out of approximately 130 teams). There was definitely some luck involved! Readers in college are encouraged to attend the ACM-ICPC if at all possible, as it makes for great practice designing and writing algorithms under pressure, as well as working in small teams.</li>

<li>My first-ever web app, SwingSet, no longer runs in Chrome, as it is a Java applet. SwingSet was designed to model the mathematics of the card game Set, and to this day, it is occasionally used by mathematicians as part of their research (or to goof around).</li>

<li>For our capstone project, my fellow seniors and I developed jAmaSeis, a Java port of the AmaSeis educational seismometer software. Put simply, jAmaSeis can be used to view real-time streams of seismometers from campuses all around the world. The project has since been acquired by IRIS (Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology), and can be downloaded for free at their <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjS8--v9fvQAhXoz4MKHSEFDhEQFgghMAE&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iris.edu%2Fhq%2Finclass%2Fsoftware-web-app%2Fjamaseis&amp;usg=AFQjCNHEfMYp8l8gyn8FYV_aIwylITc26A&amp;sig2=VrHsj5M2pr3KrQVGUGl-iw">website</a>.</li>  
</ul>

<p>While I found all my CS courses rather enjoyable, I quickly found myself seduced by the abstract beauty inherent in my upper-level mathematics courses. To that point, I'd largely underachieved in my math courses, but once I was fully exposed to the glory that is proof-based mathematics, I started thinking of math as my "primary major."</p>

<p>(Spoiler for my next "flashback": I went off to grad school and got my PhD in math in May 2015, after which things [once more] got interesting. As the old saying goes, life is what happens while you're busing making other plans...)</p>

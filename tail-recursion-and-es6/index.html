            <p><strong>Spoiler alert</strong>: As of ES6, JavaScript is a true functional programming language!</p>

<h2>What Is Tail Recursion?</h2>

<p>A recursive function is said to be <em>tail-recursive</em> if its only recursive calls are <em>tail calls</em>; that is, subroutine calls whose values are immediately returned.</p>

<p>To illustrate this definition and its special relevance to ES6, we'll consider three implementations of a function called <code>sumUpTo(n)</code>, which, as its name suggests, returns \(\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} i=1+2+\cdots+n\).</p>

<h4>Iterative</h4>

<p>The iterative implementation of <code>sumUpTo(n)</code> is unsurprising: we use a loop to systematically run through the integers from \(1\) to \(n\), all while keeping track of the sum in an auxiliary variable.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">var sumUpTo = function(n) {  
  var currSum = 0; // Initializing this to 0 allows for "empty sums"

  for (var i = 1; i &lt;= n; i++) {
    currSum += i;
  }

  return currSum;
};
</code></pre>

<h4>The "Usual" Recursive Definition</h4>

<p>To implement <code>sumUpTo(n)</code> recursively, we need only observe that $$1 + 2 + \cdots + n = \left[1 + 2 + \cdots + (n-1)\right] + n.$$</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">var sumUpTo = function(n) {  
  if (n &lt;= 0) {
    return 0;
  }

  return sumUpTo(n-1) + n;
};
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this implementation is <strong>not</strong> tail-recursive, as the value of the recursive call <code>sumUpTo(n-1)</code> is not immediately returned; indeed, \(n\) must be added to said value first.</p>

<h4>An Approach Using Tail Recursion</h4>

<p>By performing a common sort of "sleight" which I'll describe in another post, the above recursive solution can be refactored into one using tail recursion:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">var sumUpTo = function(n, currSum=0) {  
  if (n &lt;= 0) {
    return currSum;
  }

  return sumUpTo(n-1, currSum+n);
};
</code></pre>

<p>This implementation is indeed tail-recursive, because the value of the recursive call <code>sumUpTo(n-1, currSum+n)</code> is returned immediately.</p>

<h4>Homework</h4>  

<p>Before you read on, throw each of the three snippets above into your favorite ES6 interpreter (such as <a href="http://www.es6fiddle.net/">ES6 Fiddle</a>), and use them to try to calculate <code>sumUpTo(1000000)</code>.</p>

<p>(I'll wait here.)</p>

<p>As you can see, something very strange is happening. Both the iterative and the tail-recursive solution quickly return the correct answer of <code>500000500000</code>, but our original recursive solution generates a "maximum call stack size exceeded" <code>ReferenceError</code>.</p>

<p>To make matters even more interesting, if you were to run the natural "ES5-ified" versions of our three solutions, you'd find that, while the iterative solution still returns <code>500000500000</code>, both recursive solutions now yield <code>ReferenceError</code>s.</p>

<h2>What's going on?!</h2>

<p>Two questions arise here:  </p>

<ul>  
  <li>Why do the recursive solutions fail in ES5?</li>
  <li>Why does the tail-recursive solution suddenly work in ES6, while our original recursive solution still fails?</li>
</ul>

<p>As regards the former: the compilers/interpreters for most traditional programming languages, such as ES5, both (1) create a new stack frame every time a subroutine call is issued and (2) impose a limit on the size of the call stack.</p>

<p>Thus, it is not too surprising that the iterative solution works fine. Indeed, since this solution only makes one subroutine call, we are certainly in no danger of "blowing the stack!"</p>

<p>In a similar vein, both recursive solutions are doomed to fail in ES5, as computing <code>sumUpTo(1000000)</code> would require 1,000,001 stack frames, or about 5-10 times the maximum call stack size for most contemporary browsers!</p>

<p>The reason for the discrepancy between what happens with the tail-recursive solutions in ES5 and ES6 has to with a special "tail call optimization" that was introduced in ES6. Roughly speaking, an ES6 interpreter is able to execute a tail call without "growing the stack" (i.e., creating a new stack frame); instead, it "reuses" stack frames via strategic use of jump (GOTO) operations.</p>

<p>Consequently, in ES6, the tail-recursive solution consumes only one stack frame, and could thus be used to calculate <code>sumUpTo(n)</code> for arbitrarily large values of \(n\). </p>

<p>(Of course, we'd need to use arbitrary precision integers for large enough \(n\), but that's a whole 'nother can of worms...)</p>

<h2>JavaScript Redeems Itself (For Now)</h2>

<p>Now that JavaScript has proper tail calls "out of the box," it is better-posed to meet the needs of developers who prefer to program in a functional style. Indeed, right before ES6 was released, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSGEjv3Tqo0&amp;t=11m39s">Douglas Crockford</a> boldly asserted that once tail call optimization became an official part of the language, he would stop using loops altogether.</p>

<p>With that said, the observant reader will have noticed a striking similarity between the iterative and tail-recursive solutions above. This is no accident, and intended to illustrate that, in a sense, a loop is really just an a tail-recursive function in disguise!</p>
